# Maintainable Templates

Unwieldy templates are seen all too commonly in Rails apps, even among teams
that otherwise craft high quality code. Being brought into or having to maintain
a project with poorly crafted templates leads to extreme frustration and less
than adequite velocity. At philosophie, we've started to use a few simple
patterns that when practiced result in templates that are easier to maintain. By
investing a small amount of time up front learning and applying these patterns
we have saved countless hours in the long run.

Topics include:
* The Decorator Pattern
* Using View objects
* Sanely building forms
* And more!
