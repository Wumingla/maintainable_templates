# Maintainable Templates

This repo contains the [slides][slides] from a talk I gave at Rails Conf 2013 in
Portland, OR.

## Recommended Reading

* [The Rails View][rails_view] (book)
* [Presentation Model][presentation_model] (article)
* [The Exibit Pattern][objects_on_rails] from Objects on Rails (book, free)
* [Presenter Pattern][presenter_pattern] (article)

## Seeing the slides

The [slides][slides] are just a Markdown file processed with [Slyde][slyde], a
presentation tool written in Ruby. To see the slides as they were presented you
can run:

```bash
$ bundle && rackup
```

Otherwise you can just view the Markdown file.
